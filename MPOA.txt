CURRENT DEFINITION
--Two catagories of mutations--
1) Percent energy: Leftover energy alotment 
	* amount of energy that can be attributed to certain phenotypes if there is energy leftover for that tick

2) Absloute energy
	* Bare minimum energy needed to survive.

REDEFINE:
--Two catagories of mutations--
1) 	Intrinsic Attributes of Cell; able to vary from 1-99 independent of other attributes 
	(i.e. all could be 1 or all could be 99 or any other combination inbetween). The Cell "AI."
	--Cell Phobia
	--Required Division Mass
	--Required Division Energy
	--Mutation chance/coeffecient
	
	
2)	Tasks that cell must divy up energy to accomplish.
	--Movement per tick
	--Vision
	--Energy reserve
